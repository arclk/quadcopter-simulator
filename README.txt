README
This project is for the Real-Time Systems exam.
It is structured in various directories:
    -   "src"       contains the source codes;
    -   "obj"       contains the object files;
    -   "bin"       contains the executables;
	
By using the Makefile there are different options to compile the code:
    -   "all"       compiles all the code, generating all the executable;
	-	"edf"		compiles the code using the macro EDF and generates only the execution with edf as a scheduling algorithm
	-	"fifo"		compiles the code using the macro FIFO and generates only the execution with fifo as a scheduling algorithm
